<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Skin diseases affect a significant number of patients worldwide, and early detection is essential for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning (ML) to improve the accuracy and accessibility of skin disease diagnosis, especially in regions with limited access to dermatological expertise. Our goal is to develop an ML-based tool capable of classifying various skin diseases from dermatoscopic images, contributing to improved healthcare in low-resource settings.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The accurate diagnosis of skin diseases often relies on specialized dermatological evaluation, which may not be available in all areas. This project investigates the potential of ML models to assist in the early detection and classification of skin conditions using dermatoscopic images. By automating the diagnostic process, we aim to make accurate skin disease classification more widely accessible.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Models Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> An ensemble learning technique for classification tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Gradient Boosting:</strong> A boosting algorithm that builds strong models by combining weak learners.</li>
  <li><strong>AdaBoost:</strong> Another boosting technique that improves accuracy by focusing on challenging samples.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
The model is trained on dermatoscopic images, which are processed to classify different skin diseases. These images provide the input for the ML model to learn and identify skin disease types.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To develop an ML-based model for detecting and classifying various skin diseases.</li>
  <li>To create a system that is accurate, robust, and usable in low-resource settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Machine learning offers significant potential for improving skin disease diagnosis, especially in underserved regions. By automating image classification, this project aims to support early detection and treatment, ultimately enhancing healthcare accessibility and diagnostic accuracy.</p>
